1. Very important to understand the goal of automation
2. Important to understand your role in test automation contribution
    - Product Owner/Business Analyst - need to understand that without safety blanket team doesn't know where to go,
      the impact of the test automation
    - Developers - very quick response from the tests(quick feedback). Developers should contribute into unit tests. Developers may
      update the failed tests which failed because of dev-updates.
    - Testers. Automation is not replacement for testing. Manuals are still needed to explore and thoroughly interrogate
    the application. They would be the one who discover your most costly bugs. Great help for test automation initiatives
    They may contribute into triaging and maintaining the automation
