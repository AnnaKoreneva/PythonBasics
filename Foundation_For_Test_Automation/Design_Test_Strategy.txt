Goal - It is required to understand what you are going to accomplish
- Reduce Test regression cycle
- Reduce Technical Debt
- Enable continuous testing
 You need to communicate your goal with the team and stress in It

 WHO will do automation
 You need someone to:
 - write scripts
 - monitor scripts execution
 - maintain scripts (update)

 WHO:
 - developer? (time and efforts)
 - manual testers? (time and efforts)
 - automation engineer

 Involvement
- Temporary assignment
    WORKS ONLY if you have another plan and strategy for future tests
    OTHERWISE you regression scope will growth and you return to the start point
- Permanent assignment
    Invest in education
- Employ automation engineer
    Integrate AE into the team

WHAT do you plan execution
- Which tests should be automated
- Clearly defining scenarios

IMPLEMENTATION
Selecting language and used framework based on:
- Contributor knowledge
- Project language

EXECUTION
- Local (required manual intervention)
- Separate build which run several times per day/week etc. Tests should be professionally written to be sure that they
are not flaky and trusted
- CI job when someone merge the code. Requires VERY reliable tests
!!!USE gradually approach!!!

- Developers can be triaging the failures
- Be prepare to unreliable tests
