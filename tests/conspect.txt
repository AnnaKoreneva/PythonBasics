- The tests directory will contain all the test cases we will write. pytest does not require a directory named "tests"
per se, but most Python projects use it as a conventional way to separate product code from test code.

- You can also run tests using the shorter pytest command. However, I recommend always using python -m pytest.
The lengthier command automatically adds the current directory to sys.path so that all modules in the project can be discovered.

- When you enter the command to execute the tests, you will see pytest print a banner, list test modules as they run,
print a "." for each passing test case, and then conclude with the test results summary.
In our case, you should see that our one test passed. Nice! It should run very quickly, too.

- So, how can we properly handle and verify exceptions inside of a test case? We could write our own try/except block,
but thankfully, pytest actually provides a construct for handling expected exceptions: pytest.raises.

- In Python, with is a special statement for automatically handling extra "enter" and "exit" logic for a caller.
It is most commonly used for file input and output. However, f or pytest.raises, the "enter" logic makes the code catch
any exceptions, and the "exit" logic asserts if the desired exception type was actually raised.


FIXTURES
- special functions which pytest can call before the test functions
- fixtures could be shared between multiple test modules just separate the fixture to the independent conftest.py
file within the test folder
- one test case can use multiple fixtures, just make sure that each fixture has unique name
- fixtures could be used for the set up and cleanup with the words yield, everything before yield will be set up
statement and everything after will be clean up
- scope of the fixture is also configurable (the time when fixture will be run), By default the scope = 'function',
but we can set module, session https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/fixture.html

Pytest_options
pytest --help / pytest -h : help info
python3 -m pytest --verbose : information about passed and failed tests
python3 -m pytest--quiet: only summarization bout passed tests but if test fails we still see failure introspection
python3 -m pytest --exitfirst OR --maxfail=[num]
python3 -m pytest --junit-xml [file_name] - If log file already exists it will be rewritten

Configurations in file
https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/customize.html
Should be created in the project root directory

Running tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_accum.py::test_accum_add_two - run only one test
python3 -m pytest tests/test_accum.py - run all tests from the test_accum.py file
python3 -m pytest -k one - Run all tests which include the keyword 'one'
python3 -m pytest -k "not one" - boolean not means to run all tests which don't include the one keyword

https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/markers.html
python3 -m pytest -m math - To run tests which include marker math
