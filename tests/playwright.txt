Playwright tests corresponding browser engines WebKit, Chromium, Firefox.

Playwright takes a unique approach to browser setup. Instead of launching a new browser instance for each test, it uses
one browser instance for all tests in the suite. Each test then creates a unique browser context within the browser
instance, which is like an incognito session within the browser. It is very fast to create and destroy â€“ much faster
than a full browser instance.

One browser instance may simultaneously have multiple contexts. Each context keeps its own cookies and session storage,
so contexts are independent of each other. Each context may also have multiple pages or tabs open at any given time.

Contexts also enable scalable parallel execution. We could easily run tests in parallel with the same browser instance
because each context is isolated.
